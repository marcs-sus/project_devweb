            This page is a collection of ideas, concepts, and features that I find interesting and good for practice. 
            Most of what you will see here consists of unrelated elements, created just for the sake of trying things out. 
            There's no central theme or purposeâ€”it's simply a place to experiment and test different possibilities.
